- Filter Asda data for food related items (there's a column I haven't used denoting it) ? 
- More supermarkets!
- Changes over time (across all supermarkets)
- Data download?

- Shopping list page
    - Add list of groceries (from searchable dropdown?).
    - Create map of suppliers.
    - Requires products list, and products to be mapped to suppliers

- Future thoughts:
    - How does supply change with the seasons?
    - How does supply change in response to world catastrophes and geopolitical events?
