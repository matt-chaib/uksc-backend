- Standardise the naming of countries between supermarkets
- Shapefile etc... for interactive map (https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/)
- Do data transformations on the back-end.
- only show stacked bar for top 10 countries in terms of total supplies.
- Filter Asda data for food related items (there's a column I haven't used denoting it)
- More supermarkets!
- Changes over time (across all supermarkets)
- Data download?
- Make stacked bar % for each country and fix the colours so they don't change.

- Future thoughts:
    - How does supply change with the seasons?
    - How does supply change in response to world catastrophes and geopolitical events?
